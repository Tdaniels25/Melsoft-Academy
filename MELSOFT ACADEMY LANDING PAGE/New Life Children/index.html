    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>In 2016, we started a dream, one home at a time, as we saw how many children did not have access to their basic needs, which is a loving roof over their heads. On the venture of providing a home for every child in need, we saw the important impact and difference it made in their lives.</p>

    <h2>A Story of Poppy</h2>
    <p>One night in May 2021, I got this phone call from the staff: 'There's a baby in the parking area', I  very confused 'Well go fetch the baby?' (Thinking one of our little ones had managed to make their way out of the play area into the parking lot). 'No, it's not our baby, it's a newborn!  You have to come now'
        This was Princess Poppy's start.  She was found wrapped in a blanket, with a beautiful letter asking us to care for her and keep her safe.  
        Today, she's going back to where she belongs - her <em> momma.  Momma</em> is ready now.  She's prepared and she no longer feels like she cant do this.  She's spent the last 2 weeks with us getting to know her little girl and they're gonna be alright.  
        We're so thankful that we could be your safe place these last 8 months my girl.  You have so much sass and you're stunningly beautiful! 
        We pray the Lord's blessing over you. May He keep you safe and may you always know that you are loved! 
        Farewell, princess

        <h2>A little backstory</h2>
       <ul>
        <li> There are around 3.9 million orphans in South Africa, according to UNICEF.
            There are a lot of negative connotations that orphans are exposed to namely, exploitation,
            neglect, diseases and other circumstances. </li>
            <li> How we came about, is that we saw a need to provide quality care as well as love
                to the vulnerable children, regardless of their age, gender and race. This is a cause to give children
                an equal opportunity to a life that is filled with faith, love, excitement and hope.</li>
                <li>We have come up with a safe home that is state of the art in order to make a 
                    great and permanent change , whic children will be pleased to call home, and feel a sense of belonging.</li>
       </ul>

        <h2>The Need</h2>
        <p>
            The New Life Children's Home requires funding in order to launch and run. We have been
            privleged enough to have received land and sponsorship to build a few homes. We are currently
            on the lookout for organizations & individuals who would like to partener with us
            for this movement. As a community we can really make a lasting difference.
