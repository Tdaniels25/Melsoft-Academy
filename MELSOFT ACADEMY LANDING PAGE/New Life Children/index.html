    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>In 2016, we started a dream, one home at a time, as we saw how many children did not have access to their basic needs, which is a loving roof over their heads. On the venture of providing a home for every child in need, we saw the important impact and difference it made in their lives.</p>

    <h2>A Story of Poppy</h2>
    <p>One night in May 2021, I got this phone call from the staff: 'There's a baby in the parking area', I  very confused 'Well go fetch the baby?' (Thinking one of our little ones had managed to make their way out of the play area into the parking lot). 'No, it's not our baby, it's a newborn!  You have to come now'
        This was Princess Poppy's start.  She was found wrapped in a blanket, with a beautiful letter asking us to care for her and keep her safe.  
        Today, she's going back to where she belongs - her momma.  Momma is ready now.  She's prepared and she no longer feels like she cant do this.  She's spent the last 2 weeks with us getting to know her little girl and they're gonna be alright.  
        We're so thankful that we could be your safe place these last 8 months my girl.  You have so much sass and you're stunningly beautiful! 
        We pray the Lord's blessing over you. May He keep you safe and may you always know that you are loved! 
        Farewell, princess

        <h3>A little backstory</h3>
        <p>There are around 3.9 million orphans in South Africa, according to UNICEF. There are alot of negative  connotations that orpahns are exposed to namely , expolitation, neglect, diseases  and other cirumstances </p>
<p>How we came about , is that we  saw a need to provide  quality care as well as love to the fragile children regardless of their age, gender  and race. This is a cause to give  children an equal opportunity to a life that is filled with faith, love, hope and excitement. </p>
<p>We have come up with a safe home that is  state of the art to make a great and permanent change, which children will be pleased to call home, and feel a sense of belonging.</p>

<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>The New Life Children's Home requires funding in order to launch and run. It is by grace that we have recived land and sponsorship to build a few homes. We are currently on the lookout for organizations & individuals who would like to  partner  with  us for this movement. As a community we can really make a lasting difference</p><br>
